 * This package contains the necessary classes for all possible addresses that
 * could be encountered in the overlay network, as well as an Address Table
 * containing their mappings. Each node is associated with an overlay address, 
 * which is produced via a crypotgraphically secure hash function. 
 * L3Address is a subclass of Address derived from a network layer address
 * and port. AddressTable consists of the mappings from overlay addresses to 
 * layer 3 addresses.
