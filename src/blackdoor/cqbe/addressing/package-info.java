 * This package contains the necessary classes for all possible addresses that
 * could be encountered in the overlay network, as well as an Address Table
 * containing their mappings from overlay addresses to layer 3 addresses. L3Address 
 * is a subclass of Address derived from a network layer address and port and each node's 
 * associated overlay address is produced via a secure cryptographic hash function.
